# Summary

My second attempt at a camera mount for the i3 Mega 3d printer.  
I didn't realise the anycubic mega has versions with different thickness metal sheet under the base. 
Its what I use for the camera mount.
This version has two varying thicknesses...Should be good to go.
I printed with just skirt. Worked ok for me.

Tempted to shape the top oval...make it look like a star trek ship :-D
**DONE**
shhhhhhhh, Dont tell the Trekkies!!

Fixed the camera mount hole issue.


# Print Settings

Printer: Anycubic i3 MEGA
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .2
Infill: 20

Notes: 
1 suggestion for good bed adhesion; maybe try not have the cooling fan come on until 1 or 2 mm.
You can set this in Cura by going to the Cooling section.  Select the Cog to get into settings. Select "Regular fan speed at height".  I put mine to 1mm

When finished & cooled down.....the ship will crash land to let you know its done!
